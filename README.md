Additional settings required on GitHub (which do not come from the repository):

* In `Settings` (tab at the top), `Actions` (navigation on the left), `General`, activate the `Allow GitHub Actions to
  create and approve pull requests` checkbox and `Save`.  
  This will allow the gitflow-release workflow to trigger further builds in the modified branches.
